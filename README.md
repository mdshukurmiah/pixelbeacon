Enable Facebook Pixel server-side tracking using the Conversions API (CAPI) for improved tracking accuracy and reliability.

## Description

The Facebook Pixel Server-Side Tracking (CAPI) plugin enables you to send Facebook Pixel events directly from your WordPress server to Meta using the Conversions API. This provides more reliable tracking compared to browser-based tracking, especially in an era of increasing privacy restrictions and ad blockers.

### Key Features

- **Server-Side Tracking**: Send events directly from your server to Facebook, bypassing browser limitations
- **WooCommerce Integration**: Automatic tracking of e-commerce events (AddToCart, Purchase, InitiateCheckout)
- **Event Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate events when using both client-side and server-side tracking
- **Privacy Compliant**: Automatically hash sensitive customer data before sending to Facebook
- **Easy Setup**: Simple configuration through WordPress admin interface
- **Debug Mode**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and development
- **Test Connection**: Built-in tool to verify your Conversions API setup

### Supported Events

- `PageView` – Track page visits  
- `ViewContent` – Track product page views (WooCommerce)  
- `AddToCart` – Track when products are added to cart (WooCommerce)  
- `InitiateCheckout` – Track checkout initiation (WooCommerce)  
- `Purchase` – Track completed orders (WooCommerce)

### Why Use Server-Side Tracking?

- **Improved Data Quality**: Not affected by ad blockers or browser restrictions
- **Better Attribution**: More accurate Facebook Ads conversion data
- **Privacy Compliant**: Customer data is hashed before transmission
- **Reliable Tracking**: Events are sent even when JS fails or doesn’t load
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for a cookieless future

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I get a Facebook Pixel ID?

1. Go to [Facebook Events Manager](https://business.facebook.com/events_manager)  
2. Create or select a Pixel  
3. Copy the Pixel ID from the details page

### How do I generate a Conversions API Access Token?

1. Open your Pixel in Events Manager  
2. Go to the **Settings** tab  
3. Find **Conversions API** section  
4. Click “Generate access token” under “Set up manually”

### Do I need to remove my existing Facebook Pixel code?

No. This plugin works alongside your existing Pixel and handles event deduplication.

### What data is sent to Facebook?

Standard Pixel events + customer data. Sensitive data is **hashed using SHA256** before sending.

### Does this work with WooCommerce?

Yes! Events like AddToCart, InitiateCheckout, and Purchase are auto-tracked when WooCommerce is active.

### How can I test if the plugin is working?

Use the **Test Connection** tool in plugin settings. Enable **Debug Mode** for API log visibility.

## Changelog

### 1.0.4

- **Non-blocking Asynchronous CAPI Dispatch**: Implemented high-performance client dispatch pipeline via `navigator.sendBeacon()`, `fetch(keepalive: true)`, and AJAX fallback so server-side tracking never slows down page navigation.
- **Dedicated REST API Intake**: Added `/wp-json/w3-pixel-capi/v1/event` endpoint to safely ingest client events and forward to Meta without blocking PHP page rendering.
- **Full Page-Caching Compatibility**: Added `/wp-json/w3-pixel-capi/v1/dynamic-options` endpoint ensuring fresh nonces, user matching data, and cart states even under aggressive page caching (WP Rocket, LiteSpeed, Varnish, Cloudflare).
- **Synchronized Deduplication**: Guaranteed 100% accurate deduplication using standardized RFC 4122 UUIDv4 `eventID` paired synchronously across browser `fbq('track')` and server CAPI dispatches.
- **Advanced Matching Signal Persistence**: Added form input tracking (`w3_advanced_form_data` cookie) and persistent guest token (`_pbid` external_id) across subdomains to significantly elevate Event Match Quality (EMQ).
- **Order Attribution Locking**: Preserved customer `_fbp` and `_fbc` parameters in WooCommerce order metadata (`_w3_fb_cookie`) to maintain attribution across delayed payment gateways and order status changes (`processing`, `completed`).
- **Enhanced IP Normalization**: Cleaned and normalized client IP addresses against complex reverse proxies, Cloudflare, load balancers, IPv6 brackets, and port suffixes.
- **Resilient Retry Queue & Safety Cap**: Equipped background database queue with a 5-attempt retry limit and self-healing WP-Cron runner to prevent dead event loops and Meta rate limiting.
- **Admin Event & Failure Logging UI**: Integrated live diagnostics table in WordPress admin displaying recent dispatches, status badges (Success/Failed), Meta `fbtrace_id`, and a one-click log purge button.
- **Live Connection Diagnostics**: Implemented Admin "Test Connection" tool to verify Pixel ID and Access Token directly with Meta's Graph API.
